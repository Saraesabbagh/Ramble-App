### User story:

````

As a user
I want to post a journey

As a user

So that I can join in
````

### How did we approach designing our solution to the problem?
The group created a database in MongoDB with two different schemas: one for users and one for journeys.
On the front-end side, we requested the backend API using the POST method to add information about the user and their journeys in the database. Users can add start and end locations when they create a new journey. In this way, we send a request to the Google Maps API to find the geolocation coordinates and send them to us. With the coordinates, we can make another request that creates the routes of the journey.
